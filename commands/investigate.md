description: Investigate a LogNorth alert or issue, from the log to the commit that caused it
argument-hint: [path or issue hash]
---

Investigate `$ARGUMENTS` in production with the `lognorth` MCP tools, following the `lognorth` skill.

The argument is what the alert email ended with:

- **A path** such as `/api/checkout`: start with `list_alerts`, then `endpoint_timeline` for that path.
- **An issue hash** (hex characters, no slash): start with `search_logs` with `issue` set to it and `since: 7d`, then `list_issues` for its counts and trend.
- **Nothing**: start with `list_alerts`, then `list_endpoints` and `list_issues`, and take the worst one. If an app is down, start with `uptime_timeline`.

Then go through the rest of the skill's steps: the failing requests, one full trace, the code at `error_file:error_line`, and the commits just before the start time.

End with:

1. **What is wrong**: one sentence, with numbers against the normal level.
2. **Since when**: the time it started, and what changed then.
3. **The cause**: the event id, the file and line, and the commit if you found one. Say if it is a guess.
4. **The fix**: the change you propose. Do not edit files unless the user asks.

If there are no `lognorth` tools, use the skill's shell fallback ("Without the MCP tools"). In Claude Code, `/lognorth:connect` sets the tools up.
